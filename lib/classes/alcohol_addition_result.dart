/// This function uses density tables and volumetric calculations to determine

/// The formula used is based on the conservation of alcohol:

/// Where:
/// - V1 is current volume, C1 is current ABV

/// [currentWeight]: Weight of the original liquid in kilograms.
/// [currentABV]: Current ABV of the liquid as a decimal (e.g., 0.40 for 40%).

/// [additionABV]: ABV of the alcohol being added as a decimal (e.g., 0.95 for 95%).
